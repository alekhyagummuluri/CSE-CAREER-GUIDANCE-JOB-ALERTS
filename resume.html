         <h3>what is resume</h3>
         <p>A resume (also spelled résumé) is a formal document that serves to show a person’s career background and skills. In most cases, it’s created in order to help a candidate to land a new job. A traditional resume consists of a professional summary, work history, and education sections. It works like your job hunt marketing document.
           Resume, meaning summary, comes from French (though the French themselves call this document a CV</p

                What is the purpose of a resume?</h3>
                <p>The purpose of a resume is to introduce yourself to employers, present your qualifications, and secure an interview. The goal of writing a resume is to showcase your experience, education, and skills in a standardized format which is easy for recruiters to read.</p>

         <div class="resume-col">
             <h3> Simple resume formatting tips:</h3>
             <p>Set one-inch margins on each side of the page.</p>
               <p> Go for single or 1.15 line spacing.</p>
                <p>Use the legible font for a resume and keep it 11 or 12pt.</p>
                <p>Present your contact info in a separate resume header.</p>
                <p>Divide your document into easy-to-navigate resume sections.</p>
                <p>Describe your experience in the form of bullet points.</p>
                <p>Leave enough white space for a balanced resume layout.</p>

             <h3>What are the standard resume formats?</h3>
               <p> Reverse-chronological resume: a classic format 
               known to most recruiters and your best choice in most situations.
                It puts your recent or current experience upfront and promotes your proudest achievements 
                going back in time.</p>
                <p>Functional resume: puts a focus on skills rather than work history. It’s ideal for career changers and those with gaps in employment.</p>
               <p> Combination resume: a hybrid of both chronological and functional resume formats. Begins with a summary of skills, then proceeds to the most relevant experience moments—the most flexible format. </p>

         <div class="reume-col">
            <h3>What to Include on a Resume:</h3>
 

            <p>Contact information: your name, phone number, email address, and optionally relevant social media handles, such as your LinkedIn profile. In most cases, leave your address off your resume.</p>
             <p>Resume profile: a short summary of your skills and proudest accomplishments. It tops your resume and serves as your job bio.</p>
            <p>Work experience: the meat and potatoes of your job application. It’s where you tell your career history. Your job titles, company names, duties, and years worked—these go into this section.</p>
             <p>Education on a resume: your school names, degrees, major/minors, and optionally—GPA plus relevant coursework.</p>
            <p>Resume skills: job-related skills that may be of value to your prospective employer. According to statistics, a well-crafted key skills section can boost your chances of getting a new job by 59%. Include soft skills and hard skills.</p>
